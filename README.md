Basic template card to learn English vocabulary with both a British and an American MP3


Here is an example of my basic template card to learn English vocabulary with both a British and an American Mp3.

There are 3 cards :

From French word to English word and Mp3s : abeille ? -> bee + sounds of bee

From English word to French word and MP3s : bee ? -> abeille + sound of bee

From MP3s to English and French words : sounds of bee ? -> abeille + bee

You can easily generate several MP3s at once : download the AwessomeTTS add-on and use the Google Translate UK or US.

If you want to change languages, all you need to do is change the code.

Have fun !
